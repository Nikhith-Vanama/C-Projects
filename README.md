# C-Projects

> C is a powerful, procedural programming language known for its efficiency, portability, and close-to-hardware capabilities.

> It uses a straightforward syntax, allowing precise control over memory and system resources, making it ideal for system and embedded programming.

> C code is written in .c files and compiled by a C compiler into machine code, which can run directly on the target hardware.

> It supports structured programming concepts like functions, loops, and conditional statements, enabling modular and readable code.

> C is widely used in operating systems, embedded systems, compilers, device drivers, and performance-critical applications.
